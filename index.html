                    <p>My name is Charles Danner. I am working torwards my dream of becoming a programmer. Coding takes up the majority of my time, but it is not my only interest. I spend the majority of my free time listening to music, watching football, playing disc golf (casually as well as competitively), and getting together with friends. <br> <br> I enjoy reading novels as well as nonfiction books in my spare time. I generally do not watch much TV, but I do make exceptions for certain shows that I have heard are exceptionally good.
            
                    My family is originally from Missouri, so I grew up being a St Louis and Carolina sports fan. Outside of baseball and hockey, neither of which I am a huge fan of, this has been a consistent source of disappointment. Maybe next year will be different!
                
                    This is the first homework assignment given during the Bootcamp at UNCC that I am taking. <br><br>You can find links in the header to get in touch with me or look at other assignments I have completed throughout the course.
